## Projects

# Forest Fire Analysis Project in Mexico
- **Objective**: To identify a realatioship between temperatures or population .
- **Tools**: I used Tableau to create maps showing the total of forest fires in the territory, Python to clean ,analyze the data and to make vizualization, also Excel to clean data.
- **Findings**: I discovered that the recent rising of the temperatures is not directly related with the number of forest fires, but the population of the states could be strongly related.
- **Skills**: Data analysis, data visualization, Data cleansing and identify and extract Data.
- **Personal Impact**: Advanced analytical skills development and practical experience in environmental data management..
